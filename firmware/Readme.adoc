= linearstepper firmware

This folder contains the firmware compatible with Arduino Uno Boards.

== Dependencies

There are two requirements

* platformio for the firmware
* a native toolchain for the host computer (optional, only for testing)

== Pinout

We use the following pins:

* D7 as Pull
* D6 as Debug Pin
* D5 as Direction

== Flashing the firmware

When using a command line interface, use

````
pio run -t upload
````

to compile and upload the firmware.
The Arduino board has to be connected.

== Running the unit tests

Use

````
pio test -env latest_stable
````
